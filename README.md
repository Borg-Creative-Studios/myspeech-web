### About

"MySpeech is designed to be an open source, free speech resource for individuals that cannot speak.

I have always wanted to help others find their voices ever since I found mine. I grew up with Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS) and I have been blessed by God to get through it and be able to speak now with a very heavy accent, but not everyone with CAS has the same luck. Some individuals are never able to speak. 

These people often times learn ASL, but not every business has people that can understand ASL. While there are other applications and websites that provide a similar service like MySpeech's, they are not free and are very costly (Some even cost hundreds of dollars per year).

I believe that life changing applications like MySpeech should be free. Otherwise, the users have to pay to have a voice."

-Jacob Borg, Co-founder

### Development

MySpeech (Web/Mobile) is being developed in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

MySpeech will utilize [BCS Content Controller](https://codeberg.org/Borg-Creative-Studios/bcs-content-controller) to create a more efficiant system.

We are currently working on making a customizable homepage for MySpeech utilizing [Project Pear](https://github.com/Borg-Creative-Studios/Project-Pear).

At this time, MySpeech is utilizing [Text2Speech.org](https://www.text2speech.org/) for the speech system. However, once more funding is secured we intend to hire an actor to record lines for MySpeech.
